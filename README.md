# Bread Music Player
A tiny web music player where you can import, play, and save songs.
To make your music library, you can import songs from your computer and listen to them in the player.
After your library is set up, you can make playlists from the music in your library.
The point for this was because I wanted a spotify-like web app, but with as much
customization as I wanted, to where you can even edit the font itself.
## Features
- Play music
- Customize everything (colors, font, and more)
- be able to import songs (mp3, ogg, and more)
- settings and theming
## Things to Add
- be able to load recently played and generate "for you" songs from your music library
- have a music library
- have the player (pause, play, anything you can find in spotify)
- mobile responsiveness (very important)
- Shuffle playlists
